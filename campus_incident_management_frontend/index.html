          <h2>VIT Disciplinary Committee</h2>
          <p>
            At VIT Vellore, select faculty members wear red tags and serve as part of the <strong>VIT Disciplinary Committee</strong>. These members are authorized to observe and report unusual or unacceptable student behavior across the campus. The reports they submit are taken seriously and initiate a formal review process involving the Dean - Student Welfare (DSW) office.

          <h2>DSW Office Investigation</h2>
          <p>
            All disciplinary reports submitted by faculty are directed to the <strong>DSW Office</strong> for further review and investigation. Based on the nature of the incident, students may be called for inquiry, and appropriate actions are taken following VIT's code of conduct.

          <h2>Anonymous Reporting (Coming Soon)</h2>
          <p>
            To empower students to report issues without fear, we are working on a feature that will allow <strong>anonymous incident submissions</strong>. These reports will be carefully filtered and reviewed by designated authorities while ensuring the student's identity remains protected.
